Planning/Process
-I began planning for this project mentally before putting my thoughts down onto a wireframe. As I started to get an idea of how my website may look at production I started to write down more notes regarding where items would be and what features to use (i.e. show/hide/local play/a dumb ai).

-During the initial day of project work I began working on the base HTML and js for the project, completing the layout and the game logic. I thought going with a class asignment method would be best as it allowed me to easily alter the scss on the inputs in the field.

-During the second day of development I began working on some errors/bugs that were evident on the local host. I used a step-by-step method for testing where things were breaking or faultering by console logging various data forms or having a console log notify me if the intial page/event load reached a certain function. After about a half day of bug testing/fixing I moved onto styling.

-During the latter half of the second work day and the third day I finished up the styling on the page and tested the interactions between buttons. It was at this time I started to deviate greatly from my initial wireframe to go towards a tron-esque theme.

-On the fourth day of development, I tested for more bugs/issues and finished some minor portions of styling.

-On the fifth day I finalized the project based on the base requirements and then proceeded to work on a dumb AI that was finalized the final night of development.

Unsolved Problems
The one problem that I have not been able to address to my liking is the sizing of the page when the width of the client shrinks. The text will burst out of the containers holding them and on the game page the results header will jump down into the board area.
